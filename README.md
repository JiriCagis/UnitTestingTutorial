<h1> Unit testing tutorial</h1>
Goal this project is show usage unit testing on base data structure Stack, generator primes numbers by Sieve algorithm
and mapping object from/to database. Unit tests are decide for verify part of source code. In our case are it methods 
class. Unit tests are worth tool programmers when you find errors or change existing code. Right wrote unit tests
save more time in later period, after program contains thousands lines. Next advance of unit testing is automatic run it.
All tests in this tutorial are wrote in programming language Java with tool JUnit 4.0.

<h3>Stack</h3>
Dynamic data structure for save data. Structure has rule that last inserted item is take away as first. Main functions are
<b>push()</b> put item on top, <b>pop()</b> get item from top and remove it, <b>top()</b> get item on top without 
remove it and <b>isEmpty()</b> verify whether stack contain any items.
<br/><br/>
Example tests:
<ul>
<li>Create a Stack and verify that isEmpty is true</li>
<li>Push a single object on the Stack and verify that IsEmpty is false</li>
<li>Push a single object, Pop the object and verify that isEmpty is true</li>
<li>Push a single object, remembering what they are: Pop each one, and verify that they are removed in the correct order.</li>
<li>Pop a Stack that has no elements</li>
